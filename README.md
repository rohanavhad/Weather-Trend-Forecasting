# Global Weather Analysis and Forecasting

This project analyzes the **"Global Weather Repository.csv"** dataset to explore and forecast future weather trends worldwide. It demonstrates data science expertise through a mix of **basic exploratory analysis** and **advanced forecasting techniques**.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains daily weather information for cities across the globe, providing over **40 features** that comprehensively describe weather conditions. These features include:

- **Temperature**: Max, Min, and Mean temperatures.
- **Humidity**: Daily humidity levels.
- **Wind**: Speed and direction data.
- **Precipitation**: Rainfall and snow details.
- **Visibility**: Average daily visibility.
- **Other Indicators**: Air pressure, cloud cover, etc.

## Objective

To forecast future weather trends by analyzing the dataset and showcasing data science techniques through:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Uncovering patterns and relationships within the data.
   - Visualizing key weather trends using graphs and plots.

2. **Advanced Techniques:**
   - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling).
   - Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
   - Machine Learning models to predict weather trends.

3. **Forecasting:**
   - Predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
